echo "# Self-Driving Car 🚗

A personal version of the Self-Driving Car project, developed and maintained by **Raj Budhathoki**. This project showcases autonomous vehicle simulation using Python, OpenCV, and computer vision techniques.

---

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Simulates a car driving on a track with basic obstacle detection.  
- **Computer Vision**: Utilizes OpenCV to detect lanes and follow paths.  
- **Real-time Simulation**: Visualizes car movement and decision-making in real-time.  
- **Portfolio Ready**: Clean, structured project for demonstrating skills in computer vision and robotics.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)  
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
